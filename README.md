## Info
Ace is a window manager like no other (slightly resembles jbuchermn/newm), instead of using workspaces, you can use an infinite 2d grid to traverse your windows. This eliminates the limited space of workspaces, while adding a fresh experience to your unix environment!

## Q&A
Q: "Why aren't you using wayland? X11 is old and crappy"  
A: You are correct, X11 is old and hasn't improved much since a decade ago, however in the end there are many small problems in wayland (especially with nvidia) that make it inconvenient to switch to creating a wayland compositor. (see https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277 for more info)

Q: "Where is the ___ implementation?"  
A: If Ace is missing a feature (and isn't on the TODO list below) and you deem it important, create an issue and tell me what you would like.

## Features (All will be implemented at some point)
- [X] Grid like movement ("Infinity Grid")
- [ ] Window grid shifting
- [X] Basic keybind system
- [ ] Compositing (jonaburg-picom works great)
- [ ] Grid location hinter
- [X] More in-depth features listed at the top of main.cpp!

## Active bugs (Check means fixed)
- [X] None!

## Configuration
Configuration guide will be on the wiki which will be created when Ace is stable.
